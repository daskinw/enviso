When a VAT rate is created for a product category, it becomes the default rate for that category.

At a time only one VAT rate can be set as default for a particular product category.

For detailed information, refer toVAT rates.

The possibility to create VAT rates and link them to products is availableÂ only to specific venues. You can requestVintia supportto enable this feature for your venue.

The venue user can consult the audit traillogsfor the events of 'Manually confirming the order from the Sales app and Direct selling API.
